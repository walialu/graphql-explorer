# GraphQL Explorer

An easy way to explore your GraphQL API, based on the awesome
[GraphiQL][graphiql-github].

It works completely offline (apart from the connection to your GraphQL API,
which should be no problem if you have it on your local machine or your local
network too).

You can store multiple connections in your Browser's `localStorage`.

Take a look at the [demo][demo].
